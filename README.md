# CIFAR--Image-Classification
This repo demonstrates the effect of various layers on the performance of convolutional neural network(CNN) model for image classification. We compare the baseline CNN model having 3 convolutional layers, by modifying the architecture with additional layers such as Batch Normalization, varying activation functions(sigmoid, relu, leaky relu) and adding dropout layers, and increasing model depth.

## Installation
